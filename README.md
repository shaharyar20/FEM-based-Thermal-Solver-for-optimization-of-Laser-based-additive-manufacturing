Laser-based powder bed fusion of metals (PBF-LB/M) is one of the well-investigated
additive manufacturing technologies. As it opens up a wide range of industrial application
with metal manufacturing. It is also crucial to improve the manufacturing process to achieve
a product with better mechanical properties. Currently, some of the manufacturing defects
includes keyhole formation, balling, warping, etc. With a better laser profile, it is believed
that these problems could be improved greatly.
Recent years a lot of research effort was put into this field, and the laser distribution has
opened up to a much flexible formation rather than just gaussian shape. Therefore, this
project demonstrated an optimization algorithm that utilizes Finite Element Method as
Forward Simulation, inverse problem with adjoint state method for gradient, to optimize for
a laser profile with the desired temperature distribution.
